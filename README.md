## About

With rest-sinatra, success is all but guaranteed in writing RESTful Web Services! (Provided that you are using a [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) + [MongoMapper](http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper) stack.)

## Installation

It might not be a bad idea to make sure you are running the latest RubyGems:

    sudo gem update --system

We recommend a local install from Github:

    gem install djsun-rest-sinatra
    
Note: in general, beware of `sudo gem install <project_name>` -- it gives elevated privileges. Do you trust `<project name>`? Better to be safe and use a local install to `~/.gem`.
